# CA on textual data, MFA and Association Rules (AR) in *R*
Assignment realized for the course *Multivariate Analysis* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 Implementation of Factor Analysis  methods in *R*:
 - Correspondence Analysis (CA) applied to *textual data* (`words_english.txt)`
 - Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), performed on the `orange` dataset, already available in R
 
 
Implementation of Association Rules (AR) in R, performed on the `Transactions.txt` dataset

FA methods are implemented according to the following steps:

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), through which we explore and prepare the dataset
 
 2. Application of the FA method
 3. Visualizations and results interpretation


The project is entirely realized using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

For each method we built a `Rmd` file: `CA_textual_data.Rmd`, `MFA.Rmd`, `AssociationRules.Rmd`. We include in this repository also the *.html* files generated from the above mentioned notebooks, one for each  method.

More details about the followed steps and the obtained results are described in the [report](https://github.com/denaldo98/Assignment2_MVA/blob/main/Full_report.pdf) file.
